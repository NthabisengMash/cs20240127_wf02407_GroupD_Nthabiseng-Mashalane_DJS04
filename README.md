# Book Connect Web Components

## Overview

This project aims to transform the book preview functionality of the "Book Connect" application into a fully operational Web Component. Additionally, it evaluates and converts other parts of the application into Web Components to enhance modularity and reusability.

## Goals

- **Convert Book Preview to Web Component:** Encapsulate the book preview feature into a reusable and independent Web Component.
- **Assess Other Components:** Identify other elements within the "Book Connect" app that could benefit from conversion into Web Components.
- **Maintain Functionality:** Ensure that the application retains all its current functionalities after refactoring.

## Tasks

1. **Understand the Existing Codebase:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the current structure and functionality of the "Book Connect" project, focusing on the book preview feature.

2. **Create a Web Component for Book Preview:**
   - Encapsulate the book preview into a Web Component.
   - Ensure that the component is self-contained, with its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Test the component to ensure it works seamlessly within the app.

3. **Identify and Convert Other Components:**
   - Analyze the application to identify other potential components for conversion.
   - Prioritize components based on their reusability and importance to the app.
   - Convert the chosen elements into Web Components.

4. **Testing and Integration:**
   - Rigorously test the new components individually and within the context of the application.
   - Pay special attention to interactions between components and the overall user experience.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Document the process of creating the Web Components.
   - Include any challenges faced and how they were overcome.
   - Provide a clear guide on how the components should be used within the app.

## Discussion and Reflection

Prepare to discuss your experience with your coach, focusing on:

- Challenges encountered while converting the book preview and other elements into Web Components.
- The rationale behind selecting certain elements for conversion into Web Components.
- Insights gained about the advantages and limitations of using Web Components in web development.
